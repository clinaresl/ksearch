# Introduction #

This library implements a number of search algorithms to compute *K*
(non-simple) optimal paths. It provides both *brute-force* and *heuristic*
search algorithms. It also comes with a number of domain-dependent solvers that
test the performance of these algorithms


# Install #

To download the code type the following:

``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/clinaresl/libksearch.git
```

To compile the source code, create first the `Makefile` with:

``` sh
    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ make
```

from the `libksearch/` directory created after the clone. It will build the
library, a solver for every domain defined under `domains/`, and the unit tests.

# Tests #

This library comes with a number of unit tests that have been implemented with
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). If Google Test is available
in your computer, then you can compile and run the tests with:

``` sh
    $ make gtest
    $ tests/gtest
```

from the `libksearch/` directory created after the clone.

# Search algorithms #

The search algorithms provided in this library solve the *k* non-simple
shortest-paths problem. It provides both brute-force and heuristic search
algorithms:

* Brute-force search algorithms:

+ `mDijkstra`: It consists of expanding every node up to *k* times
+ `belA0`: it is the uninformed variant of BELA*
+ `K0`: Uninformed variant of K*

* Heuristic search algorithms:

+ `belA*`: Informed variant of BELA*
+ `K*`: Informed variant of K*

# Domain-dependent solvers #

This package comes with a number of domain-dependent solvers under `domains/`:

* *Grid*
* *N-Pancake*
* *Roadmap* 

For further details, check out the documentation under `domains/`
