# Introduction #

This library implements a number of search algorithms to compute *K*
(non-simple) optimal paths. It provides both *brute-force* and *heuristic*
search algorithms. It also comes with a number of domain-dependent solvers that
test the performance of these algorithms

# Dependencies #

Tests have been created using the [Google Test
Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) which is necessary for both
compiling and runing the tests, see below.designed using

In addition, a number of scripts are provided for various purposes. They all
have been implemented in python 3.8.

# Install #

To download the code type the following:

``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/clinaresl/libksearch.git
```

To compile the source code, create first the `Makefile` with:

``` sh
    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ make
```

from the `libksearch/` directory created after the clone. It will build the
library, a solver for every domain defined under `domains/`, along with a random
generator for it , and all the unit tests.

It is also possible to compile separately different parts of the whole bundle.
To compile only the library do:

``` sh
   $ make ksearch
```

which generates a static library.

To generate an executable to solve instances in a specific domain use `make 
domain` where *domain* can be any of the following: `grid`, `map`, `npancake`,
`npuzzle` or `roadmap`.

Finally, all domains (but *grid*) come with their own random generator of
instances. To generate them execute `make gen-domain` where *domain* can be any
of the following: `map`, `npancake`, `npuzzle` or `roadmap`.

# Tests #

This library comes with a number of unit tests that have been implemented with
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). If Google Test is available
in your computer, then you can compile and run the tests with:

``` sh
    $ make gtest
    $ tests/gtest
```

from the `libksearch/` directory created after the clone.

# Search algorithms #

The search algorithms provided in this library solve the *k* non-simple
shortest-paths problem. It provides both brute-force and heuristic search
algorithms:

* Brute-force search algorithms:

  + `mDijkstra`: It consists of expanding every node up to *k* times
  + `K0`: Uninformed variant of K*
  + `belA0`: it is the uninformed variant of BELA*

* Heuristic search algorithms:

  * `mA*`: Informed variant of mDijkstra
  + `K*`: Original algorithm used for solving the K shortest-path problem with heuristics
  + `belA*`: Algorithm used for solving the K shortest-path problem which is guaranteed to expand nodes only once

# Domain-dependent solvers #

This package comes with a number of domain-dependent solvers under `domains/`:

* *2D Pathfinding*
* *Grid*
* *N-Pancake*
* *N-Puzzle*
* *Roadmap* 

Every domain-dependent solver provides all the search algorithms described
above. For further details, check out the documentation under `domains/`
