# N-pancake #

Pancake Flipping is the problem of sorting a stack of pancakes of different
sizes (that is, a permutation of integers in the range *[0, n)*), where the only
allowed operation is to insert a spatula anywhere in the stack and to flip the
pancakes above it (that is, to perform a prefix reversal). 

This domain provides two variants:

* `unit`: all operators cost the same and thus, they are equal to one. The
  heuristic implemented is the GAP heuristic.
  
* `heavy-cost`: every operator has an associated cost equal to the size of the
  disc that becomes first when applying the operator. This has two consequences:
  first, there are null-cost edges (since 0 is a valid disc id); second, it
  engenders a directed graph because the cost of an operator and its inverse are
  not equal. The heuristic implemented is a weighted GAP heuristic.

The test file consist of a line per optimization task with *n+1* digits in each
line. The first digit is the task id; the next *n* digits (that must be integers
in the range *[0, n)*) must be a valid permutation representing the start state.
The goal state is always assumed to be the identity permutation. An example
follows:

``` text
0 1 0 6 4 8 2 5 3 9 7
1 3 7 2 5 8 1 9 6 0 4
2 4 9 6 8 0 3 5 1 7 2
3 0 8 3 9 1 7 4 5 6 2
4 1 8 6 4 9 5 7 2 0 3
5 9 8 4 0 3 5 7 1 6 2
6 2 1 6 4 8 9 3 7 0 5
7 1 5 8 9 3 0 7 6 4 2
8 6 7 9 8 5 4 1 2 3 0
9 3 9 4 2 8 7 5 1 6 0
```

# Usage #

This solver accepts the same flags discussed in the entry above under `domains/`
and no other specific directives are provided.

An example for the computation of test distinct paths for every case specified
above under the heavy-cost variant is shown next:

``` sh
    $ ./npancake --solver "belA0" --file test-10 --variant heavy-cost --k 10
    
      solver       : belA0
      file         : test-10 (10 instances)
      variant      : heavy-cost
      size         : 10
      K            : [10, 10, 1]
