# Roadmap #

The roadmap domain is the [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge: Shortest
Paths](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~challenge9)

The specific case is given in the file `bayareadist.gr` where every line
consists of an edge identified by its two vertices represented with integer
indices and the third value is the edge cost. Data lines are preceded with `a`
whereas comments are preceded with the hash symbol `#`.

This domain provides two variants:

* `unit`: all operators cost the same, i.e., the edge cost is ignored and set to
  one for all edges.
* `dimacs`: in this variant the edge cost is preserved. 

No heuristics are used in any case.

The particular instances to solve are given in the file `bayaredist.test` which
consists of precisely two lines. The i-th test case uses the i-th vertex from
the first line as the starting vertex and the i-th vertex from the second line
as the goal.

# Usage #

In addition to all directives discussed for all domains, this solver honours an
additional flag:

* `--size`: length of the square grid.

which is a mandatory argument.

An example for the computation of one million distinct paths for every case
specified above is shown next:

``` sh
    $ ./grid --size 10 --solver "belA0" --file test-10 --variant unit --k 1000000 --no-doctor
    
      size         : 10
      solver       : belA0
      file         : test-10 (10 instances)
      variant      : unit
      size         : 10
      K            : [1000000, 1000000, 1] 

      ‚è∫ belA0 ( k=1000000 ): 
      ‚èµ 00;1000000;(0, 0);(9, 9);18;99;1.35236;BELA*;? Unchecked

      ‚èµ 09;1000000;(9, 9);(0, 0);18;99;1.34752;BELA*;? Unchecked

      üìä Error summary: <doctor disabled>

```

Note the importance of using `no-doctor` here and that `--verbose` is unfeasible
due to the high value of *k*
