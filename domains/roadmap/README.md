# Roadmap #

The roadmap domain is taken from the [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge:
Shortest Paths](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~challenge9/download.shtml#benchmark)

The available benchmarks are stored in the directory `benchmarks`. The graphs
are suffixed with `.gr` where, every line consists of an edge identified by its
two vertices represented with integer indices, and the third value is the edge
cost. Data lines are preceded with `a` whereas comments are preceded with the
hash symbol `#`. See the available
[help](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~challenge9/format.shtml) for more
information on the formats.

This domain provides two variants:

* `unit`: all operators cost the same, i.e., the edge cost is ignored and set to
  one for all edges.
* `dimacs`: in this variant the edge cost is preserved as retrieved from the
  `.gr`file.

No heuristics are used in any case.

The particular instances to solve are given in the files `.test` which consist
of precisely two lines. The i-th test case uses the i-th vertex from the first
line as the starting vertex and the i-th vertex from the second line as the
goal. For example, the test file:

``` text
109245 150503
149048 71654
```

defines two instances. The first one consists of getting to node 149048 from
vertex 109245; and second one gets from 150503 to 71654.

# Usage #

In addition to all directives discussed for all domains, this solver honours an
additional flag:

* `--graph`: filename with the `.gr` graph definition file

which is a mandatory argument.

An example for the computation of one thousand distinct paths for every case
specified above is shown next:

``` sh
    $ ./roadmap --graph benchmark/bayareadist.gr --solver "belA0" --file benchmark/bayareadist.test --variant dimacs --k 1000
    
      graph        : benchmark/bayareadist.gr (794830 edges processed)
      solver       : belA0
      file         : benchmark/bayareadist.test (2 instances)
      variant      : dimacs
      K            : [1000, 1000, 1] 

      ‚è∫ belA0 ( k=1000 ): 
      ‚èµ 0;1000;109245;149048;0;9797;0.0410145;BELA*;‚úî No error
      ‚èµ 1;1000;150503;71654;0;114029;0.284162;BELA*;‚úî No error

     üìä Error summary: 
            Number of errors: 0
     ‚ö† No CSV output generated!
     üïí CPU time: 0.485845 seconds
```

Note that solutions are automatically checked for correctness, because
`--no-doctor` has not been used.
