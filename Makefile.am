## Define a libtool archive target
## "libksearch-@LIBKSEARCH_API_VERSION@.la", with
## @LIBKSEARCH_API_VERSION@ substituted into the generated Makefile at
## configure time.
## The libtool archive file (.la) will be installed into the directory named
## by the predefined variable $(bindir), along with the actual shared library
## file (.so).

## Define the source file list for the
## "libksearch-@LIBKSEARCH_API_VERSION@.la" target.  Note that
## @LIBKSEARCH_API_VERSION@ is not interpreted by Automake and will
## therefore be treated as if it were literally part of the target
## name, and the variable name derived from that.
## The file extension .cc is recognized by Automake, and makes it produce
## rules which invoke the C++ compiler to produce a libtool object file (.lo)
## from each source file.  Note that it is not necessary to list header files
## which are already listed elsewhere in a _HEADERS variable assignment.

## Define the list of public header files and their install location.  The
## nobase_ prefix instructs Automake to not strip the directory part from each
## filename, in order to avoid the need to define separate file lists for each
## installation directory.  This only works if the directory hierarchy in the
## source tree matches the hierarchy at the install location, however.

## The generated configuration header is installed in its own subdirectory of
## $(libdir).  The reason for this is that the configuration information put
## into this header file describes the target platform the installed library
## has been built for.  Thus the file must not be installed into a location
## intended for architecture-independent files, as defined by the Filesystem
## Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
## The nodist_ prefix instructs Automake to not generate rules for including
## the listed files in the distribution on 'make dist'.  Files that are listed
## in _HEADERS variables are normally included in the distribution, but the
## configuration header file is generated at configure time and should not be
## shipped with the source tarball.
